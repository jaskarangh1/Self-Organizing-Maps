# Self-Organizing-Maps
A SOM created for personal use.
The SOM illustrates how applied health science programs at the University of Waterloo correlates to industries defined by the Canadian Government Board of Labour. Data is based on University of Waterloo co-op data.


**Goal**: To find the relation between programs and industries and help focus job development for programs to their related industries.

## Full Self Organizing Map

An better analysis is done by grouping the graphs based on the location of their cluster. 
For example, two graphs that have cluster in the top quadrant of the graph are grouped together. 
After grouping them based off quadrants, another SOM algorithm is conducted to increase the quality of prediction of the algorithm.

The lines represent the strength of the correlation between each industry and program. The correlations are based off proximity and overlapping of clusters.
